This was a Qt/C++ team project for the Software Practices 2 course. It is an educational tool that helps with teaching
and practicing binary conventions. The game included levels, scores, and difficulty levels. It taught unsigned binary,
two's complement, and hexadecimal. One of the primary requirements of the project was integration with
<a href="http://box2d.org">Box2D</a>, which was my primary contribution to the project. Users would have balls that
they could drop into buckets associated with a binary position until they had the correct binary value. The associated
math in base 10 was also shown for the user.<br><br>

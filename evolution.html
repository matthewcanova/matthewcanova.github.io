<p align="center">Evolutionary Algorithm</p>

This was one of my earliest personal coding projects, written in Java. It was largely motivated by the problem/simulation proposed on
this page: <a href="http://www.ai-junkie.com/ga/intro/gat1.html">ai-junkie</a>. I have resisted temptations to go back
and clean it up or rewrite code, as it serves as a great benchmark in my coding history. The algorithm generates a pool
of genes represented as random bit strings. We have an arbitrary mapping to numbers and arithmetic symbols.
The algorithm assigns a fitness based on closeness to some target (a numeric value). The genes are evaluated
and then run through a series of cross-overs with roulette selection from the pool. A mutation factor is also introduced.
The algorithm ends when once of the genes has found the target value. It is only programmed with positive single-digit
whole numbers, but I have tested negative, real, and large numbers and have found the algorithm to be very flexible in
finding these solutions.<br><br>

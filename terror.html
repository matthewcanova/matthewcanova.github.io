<p align="center">Extracting Labels from News Articles on Terrorist Attacks</p>


My first big NLP project. I attempted to extract the correct labels from an article in relation to a terrorist attack. One of the
labels contained a pre-defined finite set of labels, which I was able to create a classifier for and had some precision/recall on
that particular label. The labels that required a named entity for the answer were much more difficult, and I was ultimately
unsuccessful in recalling any correctly. This project also began my education in data issues, and the difficulties of dealing with
gold-standard data. <br><br>

<p align="center">Audio Data Mining</p>

This was a pair project for a Data Mining class. It was a fairly naive project and was motivated by my desire to learn
about Speech Recognition (despite a direct course not being offered). The idea was to use Data Mining techniques (Machine
Learning techniques were not allowed for this project) to
attempt to meaningfully classify/cluster audio data. We targeted two features, words and speakers. We were unsuccessful
in meaningfully clustering or classifying either, but we learned a lot about audio pre-processing for Speech Recognition
along the way. :) <br><br>
